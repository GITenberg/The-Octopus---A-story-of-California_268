description: "The Octopus: A Story of California is a 1901 novel by Frank Norris and\
  \ was meant to be the first part of an uncompleted trilogy, The Epic of the Wheat.\
  \ It describes the wheat industry in California, and the conflicts between wheat\
  \ growers and a railway company. Norris was inspired to write the novel by the Central\
  \ Pacific Railroad and the Mussel Slough Tragedy. In the novel he depicts the tensions\
  \ between the railroad, the ranchers and the ranchers' League. The book emphasized\
  \ the control of \"forces\"—such as the power of railroad monopolies—over individuals.\
  \ Some editions of the work give the subtitle as alternately, A California Story.\n\
